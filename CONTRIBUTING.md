# Contributing to the MP3 Reduce Tool (Python Port)

Thank you for your interest in contributing!  
This branch contains the **active development** of the Python rewrite of the MP3 Reduce Tool.  
It evolves quickly, and contributions of all sizes are welcome — from bug reports to feature ideas to full pull requests.

This document explains how to contribute effectively and what to expect when working in the `pre-release` branch.

## 🧭 Branch Philosophy

The `pre-release` branch is:

- experimental  
- fast‑moving  
- occasionally breaking  
- the home of all Python development  
- the staging area for future stable releases  

The `main` branch contains the stable Bash tools and will eventually receive the stable Python versions once they mature.

## 🧪 How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug, unexpected behavior, or confusing output, please include:

- Python version  
- OS (Windows, WSL, Linux distro, etc.)  
- The log file generated by the tool  
- The command used to run the script  
- Steps to reproduce the issue  

Logs are especially helpful — the tool is designed to be transparent.

---

### 2. Suggesting Features

Feature ideas are welcome!  
Useful suggestions include:

- improvements to logging  
- CSV export enhancements  
- Windows compatibility  
- command‑line flags  
- performance improvements  
- UX refinements  
- integration ideas for UniPlaySong or Playnite  

If you're unsure whether something fits the roadmap, open an issue — discussion is encouraged.

### 3. Submitting Pull Requests

#### Before you begin:

- Make sure your work targets the **`pre-release`** branch  
- Check `RELEASES.md` to understand the current version boundaries  
- Follow the existing coding style (simple, explicit, readable)  

#### PR Guidelines:

- Keep changes focused and atomic  
- Include a short description of what the PR does  
- Update `RELEASES.md` if your change affects behavior  
- Add comments where logic may not be obvious  
- Test your changes on at least one real directory of MP3s  

#### Code Style:

- Prefer clarity over cleverness  
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies  
- Use `Path` objects for all filesystem operations  
- Keep worker functions top‑level for Windows compatibility  
- Maintain deterministic behavior  

---

## 🧪 Testing Expectations

The Python port is designed to run in:

- WSL (recommended for development)  
- Linux  
- Windows (partial support; full support planned)  

When testing:

- Ensure `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are available in PATH  
- Try both preview mode and reduction mode  
- Verify logs are generated correctly  
- Confirm parallel workers behave as expected  
- Watch for edge cases (no metadata, low bitrate, tiny files, etc.)

## 🧭 Versioning

This branch uses **semantic versioning**:
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

- **0.0.x** — sequential development, core logic  
- **0.1.x** — parallelization, logging, CSV scaffolding  
- **0.2.x** — Windows compatibility, CLI flags, CSV export  
- **1.0.0** — first stable Python release (future)  

All changes should be reflected in `RELEASES.md`.

## 🧩 Roadmap for Contributors

Short‑term areas where help is especially welcome:

- CSV export implementation  
- Windows path normalization  
- CLI argument parsing (`argparse`)  
- Improved progress indicators  
- Packaging (pip or PyInstaller)  
- Test coverage across platforms  

Long‑term ideas:

- GUI wrapper  
- Playnite or UniPlaySong integration  
- Support for additional audio formats  
- Unified media‑management toolkit
